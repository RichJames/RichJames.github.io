</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>An amateur's thougths and questions over a foundational physics experiment.</h1>
<p>I have been reading Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and am currently working my way through the 6th chapter, Quantum Behavior.  I am not new to these ideas, but was and still am excited to hear Mr. Feynman's explanation of quantum behavior.</p>
<p>In this chapter, he describes the classic double slit experiment, which appears to reveal that electrons behave both like particles and like waves.I probably should wait until I have completed reading this chapter, but I have questions right now that I want to write down in case he doesn't address them.</p>
<p>Not that I don't think they have been addressed already by the scientific community.  I hope I can find out more about that.  I would love to see the answers.  But what are these questions I have?</p>
<p>Well, first he describes how if you put a detector on the back wall, behind the slits, you can count the electrons that hit the detector in the spot where it is located.  He describes moving the detector back and forth so that you can count the electrons that hit the back wall at various points on it.  Perhaps he has simplified the explanation so much that he omits that the actual experiments have many detectors on the back wall?  I don't know, but I would like to know if that is how they have been done.  In particular, in his explanation of how the results change when they try to detect when electrons go through hole 1 vs hole 2, I am curious what would happen if many detectors were set up.  What I fundamentally am trying to know is if they can measure WHAT hits the back wall whenever they measure an electron going through hole 1 or hole 2.  Is it possible to record, say, 2 hits when it goes through one hole or the other?</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to know the results they get when firing electrons slowly, one at a time.  Very slowly.  Both when the experiment is set up to measure which hole they go through and when it is set up to not measure which hole.  Supposedly, when we are not measuring, the probability of where the electron will hit the back wall conforms to the wave probability.  But have they conclusively proven that only a single electron is fired and still exhibits this interference pattern?</p>
<p>Right now, it seems they are saying that electrons "hit" the detector as a single unit, as if hitting it with just the one electron.  But it's probability for where it will hit when two holes are available varies depending on if we try to measure which hole it actually goes through.  I'm not denying the results, but am curious if the conclusion is actually that a single electron exhibits interference patterns with itself.</p>
<p>Also, regarding measuring the electrons to see which hole they pass through.  It seems to me that using light, or any form of energy for that matter, has the potential to interfere with the experiment.  By triggering a light when passing near it, does that not interfere with the electron's path?  I've often wondered if a photon of light could change the energy state or otherwise interfere with the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles.  I'm not sure how else you could detect which hole an electron goes through though.  Could you not set up an experiment that was calibrated to shoot single electrons through hole 1 in a 2 hole experiment, then measure the distribution at the back wall?  Measuring where the electron arrives seems cleaner to me, since that is the endpoint of its path.  It might still be possibly true that measuring it even there could somehow impact whether it arrives there though.</p>
<p>So, as I stated before, I expect all of these questions have been asked before and are already answered.  What I really want is to find explanations of those experiments.  I'll do some digging after I finish this book.</p>                </article>
