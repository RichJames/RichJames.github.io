</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Getting answers to my questions (most of them, anyway)</h1>
<p>Last blog, I discussed reading Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and questions I had after reading partly through his chapter on Quantum Behavior. No surprisingly, some of these were answered if only I had finished reading the chapter before posting that blog.</p>
<p>First, he acknowledges that light could influence the results of the experiment.  In fact, he talks for a while about possible scenarios to try to reduce that impact.  It turns out that using any light at all will impact the experiment, since light comes in packets (photons) and dimming light doesn't reduce the size or energy of photons, but rather the frequency at which they are emitted.</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about scenarios where reducing or increasing the wavelength of the light might reduce the impact.  But this leads to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  Essentially, to eliminate (or sufficiently reduce the impact of the light) so that it doesn't impact the electron's path requires using light at long wavelengths.  And the problem with that is when you use long wavelengths, you can no longer distinguish which slit the electrons go through.  Effectively, the resolution is too blurry to tell what is going on.  As soon as you shorten the wavelength enough to be able to tell what is going on, the light will impact the electron.</p>
<p>In fact, the slits in the experiment need to be relatively close to one another before you will see the interference pattern in the first place. And that puts a constraint on how you can view things without impacting them.</p>
<p>As to my other question, Feynman didn't address the one on whether you could shoot an electron at a single slit and know it went through that slit. But I did some further digging and it looks like it would not be possible.  Electrons should not be thought of as a single "bullet" but rather as a cloud.  And the size of this cloud is larger than the max distance you can put the two slits and still see the interference pattern.  In a sense, an electron is "bigger" that the distance between the slits, although it will (presumably) pass through only one or the other slit.</p>
<p>I say "presumably" because it isn't clear what an electron as a cloud really means.  Is the cloud just a probability distribution of where the electron is at any given moment?  That would make it a particle ("bullet") but not one we can pin down.  Or is it some form of shapeless energy -- or maybe not shapeless, but energy in the form of a cloud?  Experiments seem to identify when an electron passes through one slit or the other, even if they do interfere with the electron's path.  I assume they have done those experiments where they fire a single electron and do observer it going only through one slit or the other and never both.  If that is true, then it seems it is the case that a single electron does pass through only one slit.</p>
<p>So I think I have my major questions answered at this point.  I will say that Feynman did a great job of explaining the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to me.  I have heard of it before, but I never really had a good understanding of it.  Or I should say, I was not happy with my understanding of it.  Feynman says that, generally, the principle is a statement about the limitations on observing effects without affecting the outcomes.  I have seen it stated elsewhere in a much stronger form that things are in two (or more) places at once and only "collapse" into a single place when observed.  I've never liked that concept.  I think it is better to say that the probability that something is in one place or the other is X% (thus it COULD be in any of these places), but upon observation, doubt is removed as we verify that it is in fact in a single location.  Observation didn't cause it to be in one spot or the other, it simply removed the uncertainty.</p>
<p>However, observation (at least at the atomic scale) also influences the behavior of the things being observed.  To observe something is to change the system. It isn't possible to observe remotely, impartially, as an outside agent.</p>
<p>Next on my list is to learn the basics of quantum computing.</p>                </article>
