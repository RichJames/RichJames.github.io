<p>I've been a technology guy in one way or another for over 30 years.  I started out as a programmer, coding first in COBOL, then C and C++.  I moved on to project management when I showed, apparently, enough maturity and doggedness that I could be trusted to run an entire project.  And that was a web app, something very new to me at the time.  I continued managing various iterations of a major web app for a large accounting firm until I finally moved on to something with even bigger responsibilities: "product management".  Actually, this was more like product portfolio management and I had the job of keeping a suite of applications, and their users, happy, productive and cost effective.  In time, this grew into an even bigger role where I was managing a team of about 15 people who each managed parts of a very large product portfolio for two major business areas of that accounting firm.</p>
<p>But as things go at said accounting firm, every 2-3 years, they do a reorg.  This is typically the result of shuffling the senior leadership so that partners get chances to burnish their resumes, careers and bank accounts via highly visible primo roles.  And each time this shuffle occurs, well, partners must make their mark.  For the CTO, the usual easiest way to do that is to reorganize the IT function, shaving people in the process to produce the cost savings the CTO promised/was charged with to help maximize that ROI for the partners.  I survived many iterations of this process until I finally didn't.  They let me go 2 years ago, proving to this rather dense tech guy that loyalty and hard work really do not mean much in terms of job security.  And I didn't just work hard and sing the party line, I was good at what I did.  They told me this every year and paid me bonuses to prove it.</p>
<p>So, I emerged from this with a very sour taste in my mouth for "working for the man." I didn't like that others could control my future like that and wanted to become my own boss.  And this brings me to: aprons.  You see, I decided I wanted to start and run a business.  And I decided the best way to do that would be to sell retail products on Amazon, at least at first.  There are many benefits to using Amazon in this way, mainly in them handling inventory, shipping, payments and hosting.  This left me with the minor problems of finding something that people might want to buy, get it made at a reasonable cost, get it delivered to Amazon, create a decent product page to showcase my product and advertise the daylights out of it so people would know about it.  Oh, and make a profit while doing all that.</p>
<p>As it happens, I concluded that aprons would be a thing worth trying.  I looked at lots of product ideas before settling on aprons.  I used tools to help me research products, the demand for such, how crowded the market was for things, etc. and concluded that bib aprons would be my first product.  My idea was to make a really good apron and initially thought I'd sell it for a modest $15 or so.  But one of the samples from a manufacturer, was of a black pinstripe denim material.  I thought it looked very classy and so settled on it.  I also decided the price could be higher to match that classier look.</p>
<p>Well, I could go on in gory detail about my experiences thus far in retail.  But the real reason I even brought it up is to point out that I had to learn completely new skills to do any of this.  Stuff that was utterly alien to my tech-heavy background.  I had to form a legal company.  I opened a business bank account.  I did product research.  I solicted bids from manufacturers, negotiated with them and reached agreement, through contract, with one to be my supplier.  I hired a freight forwarder company to manage the shipping process from the manufacturer to Amazon.  I built a home photography studio and created my own pictures for my listing.  I learned new software tools to enable this proccess: darktable, inkscape, gimp. I learned how to do tethered photography, which makes it so much easier to adjust your shots while in the studio.  I've learned and am still learning about advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>I am an old dog who has learned new tricks.  I have no particular deep love for aprons.  They chose me.</p>
<p>I don't know where all of this will take me.  It has been an emotional rollercoaster.  I am challenged every day with self-doubt and imposter syndrome.  But I push that aside and press on.  And I have not let any of that stop me from moving forward.  I am my own boss.  I own it.  I sink or swim with it.  It is scary, scary, scary.  But exciting too.</p>
